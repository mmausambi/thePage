  <p> Play with space:
  Cause an eclipse of the sun by raising your little finger (as Leopold Bloom does in Ulysses);
  Have yourself photographed holding up the Leaning Tower of Pisa;
  Start to get used to living in a state of weightlessness; forget verticals and horizontals: Escherâ€™s engravings, the inside of spaceships in 2001: A Space Odyssey.
